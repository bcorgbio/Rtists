## Introduction 

## Methods
The first step in completing our project was to select five different trans-Gulf migrant (TGM) bird species. These species should be from different families. We selected: 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Data would be sourced from human observations of these species in Massachusetts in the eBird database. Then, using a for loop that passes our species through occ_data(), we retrieved the data from the database. This information would allow us to find the Julian day for each species and see the effect of temperature and wind along the migration route to Massachusetts. Next three sample locations along the migration route are chosen: Mobile, AL, Charlotte, NC, and Boston, MA. Mobile, AL is on the Gulf, Charlotte, NC is roughly in the middle, and Boston, MA is the endpoint. Weather data from each of these locations was downloaded using a token from the NOAA website. Next the eBird data is plotted the proportion of the population that arrived and the predicted arrival time for each. Then another plot is created to illustrate how the Julian day changes over the years. This is then used to see the impact of climate on the arrival date. Weather data was then used to calculate wind direction, results were then joined with the species data. The frollmean() function is then used to calculate the mean of the weather variables 5 and 10 days before the arrival day. Lastly, a Linear Mixed-effect Model was created using lme for both weather data sets (single-day and two-week average). An Anova test was run to find the best fit model, and model testing was done using the function dredge().
